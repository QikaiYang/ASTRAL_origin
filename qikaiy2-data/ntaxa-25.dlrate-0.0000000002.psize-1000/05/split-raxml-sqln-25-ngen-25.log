================== ASTRAL ===================== 

This is ASTRAL version 5.6.3
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
61 trees read from g_trees-raxml-sqlen-25-ngen-25.trees.tree
All output trees will be *arbitrarily* rooted at 11

You may want to ignore posterior probabilities and other statistics related to the following branch branch because the effective number of genes impacting it is only 18:
